# loan-interest-rate-prediction
Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my Capstone Project, where I worked on a real-world fintech use case. The goal was to build a predictive regression model using the Bondora P2P Loans dataset to estimate customer loan interest rates.

By identifying key factors influencing loan pricing, the model enables a fintech startup to personalize loan offers efficiently and improve customer acceptance rates.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Bondora P2P loan dataset.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and key drivers of interest rates.

Build and compare multiple regression models to predict loan interest rates.

Evaluate models using metrics like R².

Deliver actionable insights to support data-driven decision making.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Techniques: Regression Modeling, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation

📂 Project Workflow

Data Collection & Cleaning – Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.

EDA & Visualization – Used charts and statistical analysis to identify correlations and key loan features.

Feature Engineering – Created meaningful features for improved model performance.

Model Building – Implemented and compared:

Linear Regression

Model Evaluation – Selected the best model based on R² ,

Insights & Recommendations – Provided suggestions for personalized loan terms.

📈 Results

Best performing model achieved R² = 0.604 with reduced RMSE compared to baseline.

Identified key features influencing interest rates, including:

Loan amount

Credit score proxies

Loan duration

Insights can help fintechs offer more competitive and tailored loan terms.
